# A class method is a type of method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. In other words, it operates on the class as a whole, rather than on a specific instance of class.
# Class methods are defined using the "@classmethod" decorator, followed by a function definition. The first argument of the function is always "cls", which represents the class.
