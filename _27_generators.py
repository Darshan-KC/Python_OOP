# Generators in Python are special type of functions that allow you to create an iterable sequence of values. A generator function returns a generator object, which can be used to generate the values one-by-one as you iterate over it. 
# Generators are a powerful tool for working with large or complex data sets, as they allow you to generate the values on-the-fly, rather than having to create and store the entire sequence in memory.
