# Python OOP

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python programs demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The programs cover various OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and more.

## Features
- **Inheritance**: Examples showing how to derive classes from base classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Demonstrations of private and protected members and methods.
- **Polymorphism**: Examples of method overloading and overriding.
- **Abstraction**: Use of abstract classes and methods.
- **Additional Python Features**: Other useful Python features that complement OOP, such as decorators and context managers.

## Getting Started
To get started with the code in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python_oop.git
    cd python_oop
    ```

2. **Explore the Code**:
    - Navigate through the various Python files to understand different OOP concepts.
    - Each file is named according to the concept it demonstrates (e.g., `class_method.py`, `encapsulation.py`).
