# The Walrus Operator is a new addition to Python 3.8 and allows you to assign a value to a variable within a expression. This can be useful when you need to use a value multiple times in a loop, but don't want to repeat the calculation. 
# The Walrus Operator is represented by the := syntax and can be used in a variety of contexts including while loops and if statements.
