# Function Caching in Python

# Function caching is a technique for improving the performance of a program by storing the results of a function call so that you can reuse the results instead of recomputing them every time the function is called. This can be particularly useful when a function is computationally expensive, or when the inputs to the function are unlikely to change frequently.

# In Python, function caching can be achieved using the functools.lru_cache decorator. The functools.lru_cache decorator is used to cache the results of a function so that you can reuse the results instead of recomputing them every time the function is called. 

import functools
# from functools import lru_cache
